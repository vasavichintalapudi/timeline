    <h1>Historical event in 2020</h1>
    <h2>The Killing of George Floyd</h2>



    <p>On May 25, George Floyd, a forty-six-year-old Black man, was arrested in Minneapolis for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill. One of the arresting officers kept his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and fifteen seconds, killing him.Floyd’s death at the hands of officers whose mission is to “protect and serve” followed on the heels of literally hundreds of similar police killings of Black Americans, including Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, and Breonna Taylor.Video of Floyd’s killing triggered protests across the United States and sparked a long overdue national conversation about systemic racism. But the protests and conversations about justice and equality went far beyond America’s borders. </p>
<p> From Paris to Nairobi to Rio de Janeiro, people took to the streets to protest Floyd’s death and to highlight their own countries’ racial inequalities. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that “Racism is real. It’s in the United States, but it’s also in Canada.” But the same could be said of most other countries, including those like China and Iran that seized on Floyd’s death as evidence of U.S. hypocrisy on human rights issues. Injustice and inequality remain a global challenge.</p>
