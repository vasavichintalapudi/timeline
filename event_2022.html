    <h1>Historical event in 2022</h1>
    <h2>World population crosses 8 billion</h2>



    <p>2.5 billion people in 1950, and 8 billion people in 2022 & with this speed more than 10 billion by the end of this century. The numbers are growing at a massive rate. Presently, the world population crossed 8 billion in 2022, with India being the largest contributor for this reach, (as per UN). India contributed 177 million to the final score. A girl born in Tondo, Manila named Vinice Mabansag was considered as the 8 billionth person (the number is symbolic as it is hard to calculate the exact number worldwide). India is supposed to cross China as the worldâ€™s most populous nation in 2023. These 8 countries will be contributing much to an increase in population by 2050- the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>
